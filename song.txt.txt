First light of day welcoming you to Adventureland
Keys to the Kingdom of the Skies still in your hand
Each day a laughter to expand
You find raindrops kiss best when you dance
True life is a dream and you its only dreamer
Until

Too soon fear wraps you up in sadness
Illusions lead you to their madness
here can you lean when The Earth becomes the sun
And the hand that guides you pulls you under
All that you knew now torn asunder
Breathe in child
Remember who you are
